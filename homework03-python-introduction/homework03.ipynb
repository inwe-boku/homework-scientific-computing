    "[3blue1brown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxAaO2rsdIs) has a great video on the topic. If you are interested in a model which is a bit closer to the real world, but still quite simple, have a look at the [SIR model](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qrp40ck3WpI). A large part of this is inspired by the [German Wikipiedia page](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistische_Funktion)."
