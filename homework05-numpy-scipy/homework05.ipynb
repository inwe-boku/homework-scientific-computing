Look at the shape of the image and pick the right axis by looking at the length of the array in this axis! You can first calculate a weighted version of the array by multiplying with a vector of length 3 (and the three weights) and then sum along the right axis. Check the shape of the gray image afterwards and plot it using `plt.imshow()` with the parameter `cmap='gray'`. It should be only two dimensional now. Use `image_gray.flatten()` to get all pixels as one-dimensional vector and pass this to the function `plt.hist()` with the parameter `bins=50` to get 50 bins with different gray values."

Multiplying the array with 255 will restore the original 8bit values (integer values between 0 and 255). After multiplying by 255 use `image = image.astype(int)` to convert the image to integer type. Plot the `image` using `plt.imshow()` to see the image and guess the result. Check the shape of the array. One of the axes is of length three - this is the color axis (red, green and blue). We want to map all colors to unique integers. This can be done by defining `colors = red  + green * 256 + blue * 256**2`. This is a unique mapping between the triples `(red, green, blue)` and the integers `color` similar to decimal digits (three values between 0 and 9 e.g. `(3, 5, 1)` can be mapped to a three digit number `3 + 5 * 10 + 1 * 100 = 153`). Then use `np.unique()` to get an array with unique colors (in the mapped form as in `color`). This can be used to determine the number of unique colors in the image. This value can also be used to calculate the percentage of the color space used.\n",
